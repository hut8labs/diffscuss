* use the head/sha to make sure we're getting a consistent view of the world
we don't care if new comments etc. come in during the api calls, but we do care
if we're referring potentially to different positions in files etc.

so call the top level pr once at the beginning, get the sha, once at the end,
bail if different

* raw gh pr

which is the jsons in various spots, gets translated into the cooked one

that way we can construct a cooked one for tests

* for pagination

use a paginated struct, which is just the paginated link, return the jsons

* pass a max depth of 2 for creating comment in gh
