* pass a max depth of 2 for creating comment in ghA

maybe put settings at top of diffscussion?

* comments in github.go
* what to do about email header?  put it in and tolerate but not set it?
* extract constants for #, -, *, etc.
* mode: github implies all hunk & file comments go to next line & also threads @ 1
* sigh, removing blank header lines and option lines means our lines counts won't be the same pre and post parsing
